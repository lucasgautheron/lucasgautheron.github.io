abstract = {With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language experience and the association between children's production and their input. In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%, potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.},
